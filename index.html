  </p>

  <h2>Why Golf-Specific Fitness Is Essential</h2>
  <p>
    Each year, golfers spend thousands chasing new drivers or irons promising more distance. The reality is, the body is the engine behind every shot. 
    The stronger, more flexible, and balanced you are<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1krIxq90R9HaeO_GD3Zozill4Mkknv4DdkGi1TLUSjp0/edit?gid=0#gid=0">,</a> the more reliable and powerful your swing becomes. At <strong>Golf Fitness Dallas</strong>, we use proven science and experience

  <h2>TPI Golf Fitness Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Every golfer’s body moves differently. The <strong>TPI Golf Fitness Assessment</strong> identifies your range of motion, flexibility, balance, and strength. 
    This data reveals the physical limitations affecting your swing. Once we understand those, we build a program to correct them, 
    improving consistency and reducing risk of injury.

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Range of Motion:</strong> Unlock your body’s rotation for a more powerful swing.</li>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Build core stability for greater accuracy and endurance.</li>
    <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Maintain control throughout your swing motion.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Protect joints and generate speed safely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real Results from Real Golfers</h2>
  <p>
    “Before starting with Chris, I was losing distance and dealing with back pain. After my assessment and training plan, 
    I gained flexibility and strength. Within eight weeks, my drives were consistent, and I can play pain-free.” – Mark R., 66, Dallas TX
  </p>
  <p>
    These are common stories from golfers who commit to fitness. When your body moves better, your game naturally improves.
  </p>

  <h2>Golf Fitness and Science</h2>
  <p>
    According to research published in the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em>, golfers who completed targeted strength 
    and flexibility training increased their clubhead speed by <strong>4–6.4%</strong>. This means that focused golf-specific conditioning 
    directly impacts performance and helps prevent injury.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How is golf-specific training different from gym workouts?<br>

  balance, and mobility in the exact muscles used during your swing.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How long before I see improvement?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Most clients notice better flexibility and control within 4–6 weeks, with significant performance gains after 12 weeks.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it suitable for beginners?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. Every program is customized to your fitness level, age, and physical needs.</p>
